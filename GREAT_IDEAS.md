## 💡 WHY THESE MATTER

### What Makes MMORPGs Addictive

**Current Strengths:**
- ✅ Social dynamics (coups, alliances, political intrigue)
- ✅ Progression (leveling, training, reputation)
- ✅ Territory control (kingdoms, properties)

**Missing Elements:**
- ❌ Daily login incentives (quests, streaks, events)
- ❌ Tactical variety (consumables, buffs, builds)
- ❌ Recognition (achievements, titles, leaderboards)
- ❌ Urgency (timed events, world events, limited offers)
- ❌ Player economy (trading, auction house)

---

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED START: Consumables

**Highest ROI because:**
1. Easy to implement
2. Creates economy - Players buy/craft/trade them
3. Tactical depth - "Should I use my buff for this coup?"
4. Retention - "I need to log in to use my daily buff"

Then add daily quests as they create login habits and give players clear goals every session.
