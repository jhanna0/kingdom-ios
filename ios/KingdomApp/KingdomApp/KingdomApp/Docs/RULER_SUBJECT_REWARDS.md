# Ruler & Subject Mechanics

## Ruler Powers
- **Set Tax Rates**: 0-100% of resources mined by subjects
- **Issue Daily Quests**: Kingdom-wide objectives with treasury rewards
- **Declare War**: Launch invasions (requires 10+ attackers)
- **Manage Treasury**: Fund building contracts, quest rewards, subject bonuses
- **Distribute Rewards**: Share 0-50% of kingdom income based on merit

### Reward Distribution
Rulers can distribute income to subjects using merit score:
```
Merit = (reputation × 1.0) + (skillTotal × 0.5)
Share = (playerMerit / totalMerit) × rewardPool
```

**Eligibility**: 50+ rep, checked in within 7 days, not ruler/banned  
**Cooldown**: 23 hours between distributions

## Subject Actions (Once Per Day)
1. **Mine Resources** - Collect iron/steel (ruler takes tax %)
2. **Work on Crafting** - Progress weapon/armor by 1 day
3. **Contribute to Buildings** - Add 1 work unit to kingdom projects

## Progression
- **0-99 rep**: Newcomer (basic actions)
- **100-299 rep**: Citizen (can own property)
- **300+ rep**: Veteran (can initiate coup)

**Earn Rep**: Daily actions (+1), invasions (+50), quests, defending (+30)

## Property Ownership
**Houses (Tier 1-5)**:
- T1: "Citizen" badge + 10 rep
- T2: 50% travel cost reduction + instant travel
- T3: 10% faster actions (mine/craft/build)
- T4: 50% tax reduction
- T5: 50% chance house survives conquest
(I think these should give bonus money "build shop in house", better build, better craft?)

**Requirements**: 100+ rep, enough gold  
**Risk**: -2 levels if kingdom conquered

## Travel System
- **Cost**: 10g per km
- **Time**: distance / 5km per minute
- **Property Bonus**: 50% cost reduction + instant travel

## Economy

### Kingdom Treasury (Ruler)
**Income**: Subject taxes, conquest loot, failed coup fines  
**Expenses**: Building upgrades, quest rewards, subject bonuses

### Subject Gold
**Income**: Mining, quests, invasion loot, property, merit rewards  
**Expenses**: Crafting, property, invasion fees (100g), coups (50g)

## Key Rules
- All actions require physical presence at kingdom location
- One major action per day (choose wisely)
- Higher rep = more rewards + more power
- Fair taxation = loyalty, exploitation = rebellion risk
