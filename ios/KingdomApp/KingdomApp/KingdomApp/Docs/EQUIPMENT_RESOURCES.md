# Equipment & Resources

## Weapon System

### Weapon Types (Risk vs Reward)
```
Bow:      Low damage, 75% death risk if lose
Sword:    High damage, 100% death risk if lose
```

### Weapon Tiers (1-5)
Higher tier = more attack bonus

```
Tier 1 Sword: +1 attack
Tier 2 Sword: +2 attack
Tier 3 Sword: +3 attack
Tier 4 Sword: +5 attack
Tier 5 Sword: +8 attack

(Same scaling for all weapon & armour types)
```

### Crafting Time (Daily Work)
```
Tier 1: 1 day of work
Tier 2: 3 days of work
Tier 3: 7 days of work
Tier 4: 14 days of work
Tier 5: 30 days of work
```
*Note: You can only work on your craft ONCE per day. Must be at kingdom location.*

## Resources (SIMPLE)

### One Building: Mine

```
Mine Level 1: 10 Iron per mining action
Mine Level 2: 20 Iron per mining action
Mine Level 3: 10 Steel per mining action (no iron)
Mine Level 4: 20 Steel per mining action (no iron)
Mine Level 5: 10 Iron + 10 Steel per mining action (BOTH!)
```

*Note: You can only MINE once per day. Go to mine, collect resources, come back tomorrow.*

### Resources Needed to Craft
```
Tier 1 Weapon: 10 Iron, 0 Steel
Tier 2 Weapon: 20 Iron, 0 Steel
Tier 3 Weapon: 0 Iron, 10 Steel
Tier 4 Weapon: 0 Iron, 20 Steel
Tier 5 Weapon: 10 Iron, 10 Steel (both!)
```

### How It Works
1. Go to your kingdom's mine location (once per day)
2. Tap "Mine" - collect resources (based on mine level)
3. Spend resources + gold to start crafting weapon
4. Each day, tap "Work on Craft" to progress (Tier 5 = 30 days of work)
5. Equip weapon, get attack bonus

**Key:** Every action can only be done ONCE per day - mining, crafting work, building upgrades. Must be at kingdom location.

## Battle Losses

### If You LOSE Battle:
- **Weapon destroyed** (lose Tier 5 = lose 30 days of work!)
- **Death chance** based on weapon type:
  - Bow/Crossbow: 50-75% death chance
  - Sword/Lance: 100% death chance (always die)

### If Your Kingdom Gets Conquered:
- **Mine damaged**: -2 levels
- Example: Mine Level 5 → Level 3 (lost iron production!)
- Takes weeks to rebuild

## Example Flow

```
Day 1: Go to mine (level 5), tap "Mine"
→ Collect 10 iron + 10 steel

Day 1: Start crafting Tier 5 Sword (1/30)
→ Spend: 10 iron, 10 steel, 3000g
→ Must work on it 30 days

Days 2-30: Visit kingdom, tap "Work on Craft"
→ Mine resources each day too
→ Sword progress: 2/30, 3/30... 29/30

Day 30: Final day of work - Sword complete! (30/30)
→ Equip it, get +8 attack

Day 35: Join invasion, LOSE battle
→ Sword DESTROYED (30 days of work wasted!)
→ 100% death chance (sword user)
→ You die, lose everything
```

## Spy Intel

Visit enemy kingdom to see:
- All active players in that kingdom
- Their weapon tier (can see that Tier 5!)
- Their stats
- Kingdom's mine level, buildings
- Estimate their strength before attacking

**Trade-off:** If you spy today, you CAN'T mine/craft at your own kingdom (one location per day)
