# Ruler & Subject Mechanics

## The Ruler's Role

### Powers
- **Set Tax Rates**: Take % of resources mined by subjects
  - Example: 10% tax = every subject mining gives 10% to treasury
  - Too high = rebellion risk
  - Too low = weak treasury for defense

- **Issue Daily Quests**: Give kingdom-wide objectives
  - Examples:
    - "Mine 100 total iron this week"
    - "3 subjects craft weapons"
    - "Everyone achieves 7-day streak"
  - Set rewards from treasury
  - Keeps subjects engaged

- **Declare War**: Initiate invasions on neighboring kingdoms
  - Must recruit 10+ attackers first
  - Controls when to launch
  - Gains conquered territory

- **Manage Treasury**: Spend on:
  - decides which contracts for Building upgrades (walls, mines, etc) -> distribution of players
  - Quest rewards
  - Bonuses for loyal subjects
  - War preparations

### Responsibilities
- Check in regularly (or get auto-abdicated)
- Keep treasury funded
- Defend against invasions/coups
- Keep subjects happy (or face rebellion)

## Subject Life

### Daily Actions (Once Per Day Each)
1. **Mine Resources**
   - Go to kingdom mine
   - Tap "Mine" 
   - Collect iron/steel (based on mine level)
   - Ruler takes tax %

2. **Work on Crafting**
   - Progress weapon/armor by 1 day
   - Must be at kingdom location

3. **Contribute to Buildings**
   - Add 1 work unit to kingdom projects
   - Example: Wall upgrade needs 100 work units = 100 daily contributions
   - each action still needs to take time. 2 hours?

### Progression Path
- Start with 0 reputation
- Build rep by:
  - Daily actions (+1 rep each)
  - Winning invasions (+50 rep)
  - Completing ruler quests (+variable)
  - Defending kingdom (+30 rep)

- At 300+ rep: Can initiate COUP (try to become ruler)

### Why Be a Subject?
- **Get stronger**: Mine resources → craft weapons → higher attack/defense
- **Earn gold**: Complete quests, win invasions, trade
- **Own property**: Buy land/buildings with earned gold (generates passive income)
- **Path to power**: Build 300+ rep → coup → become ruler
- **Community**: Work with others toward kingdom goals

## Properties & Land Ownership

### What Can You Own?

**Houses (Tier 1-5)**
- **Tier 1**: Badge "citizen" and + 10 rep
- **Tier 2**: 50% travel cost reduction + instant travel to kingdom
- **Tier 3**: food eating- plant a garden: 10% faster on all actions (mine, craft, build)
- **Tier 4**: 50% tax reduction (aesthetic bonus for beautifying kingdom)
- **Tier 5**: 50% chance house survives kingdom conquest (during razing)

### Buying Property
- Must have enough gold
- Must have 100+ rep in kingdom
- Prices scale with kingdom size

### Property Benefits
- **Passive income**: Collect when you visit
- **Status**: Shows investment in kingdom
- **Voting power**: Large landowners influence kingdom decisions
- **Safety**: Can't be easily seized (unless kingdom conquered)
- **Fast travel**: Instant travel to kingdoms where you own property
- **Travel discount**: 50% cheaper to travel to kingdoms where you own property

### Risk
- If kingdom conquered: Properties damaged (-2 levels, like buildings)
- If you start failed coup: Ruler can seize property

## Travel System

### Travel Costs
- Traveling to another kingdom costs gold based on distance
- Formula: 10g per km
- Example: SF to Oakland (20km) = 200g

### Travel Time
- Without property: Must wait (distance / 5km per minute)
- With property: Instant fast travel

### Property Travel Bonus
If you own property in target kingdom:
- 50% travel cost reduction
- Instant travel (no wait time)
- Example: Travel to Oakland normally 200g + 4min wait → With property: 100g + instant

### Strategic Uses
- Spying on enemy kingdoms (expensive without property)
- Invasion signup (cheaper if you own property there)
- Emigration (buy property first for easier move)
- Multi-kingdom operations (own properties in multiple cities)

---

## Power Dynamics

### Subject → Ruler Relationship
- Ruler needs subjects (defense, resources, military)
- Subjects need ruler (protection, quests, treasury spending)
- Balance: Fair taxes vs exploitation
- Tension: Always possibility of coup

### Subject → Subject Relationships
- **Trading**: Swap resources (iron for steel)
- **Gifting**: Help others finish crafts
- **Rivalry**: Local leaderboard for rep/wealth
- **Cooperation**: Work together on kingdom quests
- **Alliances**: Coordinate for coup or defense

---

## Key Mechanics

### One Action Per Day
You can EITHER:
- Mine at your kingdom
- Work on your craft
- Spy on enemy kingdom
- Contribute to building

**Choose wisely!** Going to spy means losing daily mining income.

### Location-Based
All actions require physical presence at kingdom location. Can't just "do it from home."

### Reputation System
- 0-99: Newcomer (basic actions only)
- 100-299: Citizen (can own property)
- 300+: Veteran (can start coups)

Reputation = trust and standing in kingdom.
